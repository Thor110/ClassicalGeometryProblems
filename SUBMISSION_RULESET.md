These are rules pertaining to the keys listed in the approximation charts.

Base Ruleset			- the base ruleset.
25 Circles Maximum
40 Lines Maximum

Extended Ruleset		- an extended ruleset, for constructions that begin to approach perfect ≥ 99.91%
49 Circles Maximum
80 Lines Maximum

Key						- key marks to be added to the left hand side of method holders names.
~ = Contested			- this means that the construction is contested and proof of the original discoverer is being sought.
@ = Too Simple			- this means the construction is too simple.
µ = Micro Scale Edits	- this means that micro scale adjustments are made, which would be difficult, if not impossible to reproduce on paper.

Verification			- whether the construction is verified or not.
Unverified
Verified

Min/Max					- minmum and maximum degrees of accuracy accepted.
95% Minimum
100% Maximum

Counting				- construction steps being counted.
Circles
Lines

Not Counting			- construction steps not being counted
Macro Scale Midpoints	- macro scale midpoints are not counted, which refers to midpoints which are easily reproducable on paper, beyond that mark the construction for micro scale edits.
