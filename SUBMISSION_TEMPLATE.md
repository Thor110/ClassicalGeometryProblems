# Approximation Submission Template

If you wish to submit a geometric approximation to one of the classical problems, please copy and fill out the following template.  
All constructions should adhere to the strict Euclidean ruleset (straightedge and compass only), unless explicitly noted otherwise.

---

**Problem:** (Squaring the Circle / Trisecting an Angle / Doubling the Cube / Rectifying the Circle / Arc Rectification / π Approximation)

**Method Name:**
Provide the title or informal name of your method or construction.

**Author:**
Your full name (or pseudonym) and the date of creation, in the form of DD/MM/YY (e.g. 07-11-2025).

**Accuracy (%):**
Approximate accuracy of your construction, ideally calculated numerically (e.g. 99.816%).

**Oversized / Undersized:**
Specify whether the construction produces a result larger or smaller than the theoretical value.

**Number of Circles:**
How many circles are drawn during the construction.

**Number of Lines:**
How many lines are drawn during the construction.

**Verification Method:**
Specify how you verified the result (GeoGebra, Desmos, Analytical Proof, Manual Calculation, etc.)

**File(s):**
List any included files (e.g. .ggb, .pdf, .png, .jpg, etc.)

**Description:**
Provide a concise explanation of the geometric reasoning behind the construction.  
If applicable, mention how it differs from or improves upon existing methods.

**Notes / Limitations:**
Mention any known limitations (e.g. only valid for certain angle ranges, partial rectification, etc.)

**Optional:**
If you wish, you may include images, figures, or GeoGebra links to aid in reproduction and verification.
