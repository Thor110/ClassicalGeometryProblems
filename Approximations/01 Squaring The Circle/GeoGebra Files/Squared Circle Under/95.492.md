**Description:**
This was a very simple early attempt from when I initially started exploring approximations for the problem.

**Notes / Limitations:**
I believe this construction is too simple and as such I have marked it as both too simple and contested on the approximation chart, because historically this construction is guaranteed to exist somewhere.
