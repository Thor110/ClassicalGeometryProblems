**Description:**
Reconstruction references used:  
- Jagathapu Kasi Rao — “Squaring the circle (Ramanujan reconstruction)”. https://www.intmath.com/blog/squaring-circle-kasi-rao-jagathapu.pdf  
- GeoGebra implementation used during reconstruction: https://www.geogebra.org/m/JGP5haXN

**Notes / Limitations:**  
Ramanujan’s original presentations are terse and often omit explicit compass/straightedge step wording. Some small inferences were made during reconstruction; these are documented in the accompanying GeoGebra file.
