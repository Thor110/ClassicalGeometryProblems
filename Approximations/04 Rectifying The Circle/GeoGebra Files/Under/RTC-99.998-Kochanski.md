**Description:**

**Notes / Limitations:**
Because the paper omits part of the required steps for the construction, I had to infer a method to arrive at the same construction. - Edward James Gordon

**Source quote (verbatim):**
"We start with drawing a semi-circle of radius AB = 1 centered at A, inscribed in a rectangle BGHD. Than we draw a line AI such that ∠IAC = 60°. ..."

**Ambiguity / missing step(s):**
- The paper omits explicit construction of rectangle BGHD. We inferred a method for the construction.

**Inference performed:**
- I used circles to get the relavant angle for "IAC = 60°" this should be clearly visible in the GeoGebra construction.
